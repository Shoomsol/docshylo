### hyUSD

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Scalability" icon="chart-line">
    hyUSD is made capital efficient by the issuance of xSOL. A relatively small amount of xSOL can support a large supply of hyUSD, allowing Hylo to scale beyond the limits of existing decentralized stablecoins.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stability" icon="shield">
    xSOL acts as a volatility shield, absorbing price movements in the underlying collateral pool to maintain the peg on hyUSD.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Censorship Resistance" icon="lock">
    Hylo is entirely independent from banks and other custodians, storing collateral assets on chain in transparent and 24/7 auditable vaults.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Native Yield" icon="money-bill-trend-up">
    Since hyUSD is backed by Solana LSTs, it can sustain and distribute natural yield in any market condition.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
<Card title="Deep Liquidity" icon="water">
    hyUSD can be redeemed for its net asset value at any time without incurring slippage, regardless of the transaction size. Unlike other stablecoins that can face liquidity shortages during high redemption periods, hyUSD doesn't face this problem since 100% of its backing assets are liquid and accessible at any time.
