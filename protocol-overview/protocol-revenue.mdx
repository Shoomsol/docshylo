# Protocol Revenue

Hylo is designed to generate revenue through two main channels: **mint/redeem fees** and **LST yield produced by the collateral pool**.

## LST Yield

The LSTs held in collateral pool are projected to yield a base APY between 8-11%. A large majority of this yield is allocated to those participating in the stability pool, with the remainder serving as a direct source of revenue for Hylo&apos;s treasury.


## Mint/Redeem Fees

Minting and redemption fees are the protocol&apos;s primary revenue stream. All trading transactions incur a fee on the order of basis points, with fees varying depending on health of the protocol. See [Risk Management](/protocol-overview/risk-management) for an overview of the fee structure.

<Note>
As hyUSD gains distribution as a quoted asset for token pricing, the fee revenue stream may become more important than staking yield. Increased usage will create more arbitrage opportunities, leading to higher minting and redeeming volumes.
