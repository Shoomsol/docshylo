## Foundation of the On-Chain Economy

Stablecoins are the first crypto asset to have achieved true product-market fit globally, dominating trading pairs across centralized and decentralized exchanges. In 2023, stablecoins facilitated over [$12 trillion in on-chain transactions](https://messari.io/assets/stablecoins), accounted for [over 90% of trades](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/stablecoins-statistics), and constituted  [between 20-40%](https://defillama.com/) of total value locked (TVL) on the largest DeFi protocols.

## Centralization Considered Harmful

DeFi democratizes access to markets through innovative and permissionless investment instruments only possible on the blockchain. Stablecoins play a critical role in DeFi as a fixed store of value and liquidity for traders, analogous to fiat currencies like USD in traditional financial markets. However, the dominant stablecoins on the market today carry significant centralization risks which make them misaligned with DeFi's stated mission.

* **Dependence on central banks.** USDC and USDT are collateralized by treasury bonds whose yields are subject to the agenda of the Federal Reserve.
* **Un-hedgeable custodial risks.** Evolving country-specific regulations place the bank accounts holding collateral at risk of censorship and seizure.
* **No rewards, only risk.** Circle and Tether internalize the yields generated from backing assets while subjecting users to depegging and inflation.

Recent history has demonstrated the risks inherent to centralized stablecoins, with government agencies and corporations intervening in their issuance, redemption, and transmission.
